# Prettier Interface

Now that we have many activities, the list on the left is too long so it is hard to navigate. And the add dialog is far away from the activity.

- Move the cards to the bottom

- Remove the registration form and replace it with a "register student" button on each activity card.

- Make sure it looks good on desktop and phone.

I second this idea. I'm having trouble finding my activity.
100% support this. Nice idea! Looking forward to the update.
Don't forget about tablet's too.
