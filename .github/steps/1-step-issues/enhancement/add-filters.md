# Add filters

There seems to be no order to the activities. Please fix this.

Here are my ideas, maybe in a toolbar above the activity cards.

- Add some filters, for example by category. If needed, add a field to the JSON.
- Add options to sort, for example by name or time. If needed, add a date field but leave the textual description version of the time.
- Add a free text search.

Obviously, make sure it still looks good on desktop and phone.

This will be so useful. We should be proactive and do this before the list gets even longer.
Let's do it! I would love to help out. I just took a coding class. ðŸ¤“
